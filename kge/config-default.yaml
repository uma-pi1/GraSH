# Options of training jobs (job.type=="train")
train:
  # Split used for training (specified under 'dataset.files').
  split: train

  # Type of training job (see respective configuration key). LibKGE ships with
  # the following jobs:
  # - KvsAll: scores each unique sp/po/so pair along with all possible completions.
  # - negative_sampling: scores each unique spo triple along with sampled corrupted
  #   triples
  # - 1vsAll: scores each spo triples against the complete set of s/p-corrputed triples
  #   (all treated negative)
  type: KvsAll

  # Loss used for training (bce, kl, or margin_ranking).
  #
  # KL divergence / cross entropy (kl, all training types): Take softmax over a
  # set of scores, then compute KL divergence between the so-obtained model
  # distribution and data distribution. Computed once for each positive triple
  # and slot (i.e., separately for the subject, relation, and object slots).
  # Equivalent to cross-entropy loss often found in the literature.
  #
  # Margin ranking (margin_ranking, negative_sampling only): Compute margin
  # between score of positive triple and score of one of its negative triples.
  # Computed once per negative triple. See loss_arg for parameters.
  #
  # Binary cross entropy (bce, all training types): Apply logistic function to
  # score of triple, then compute binary cross entropy w.r.t. the respective
  # true label. Computed once for each positive and once for each negative
  # triple in the batch. See loss_arg for parameters.
  #
  # Squared error (se, all training types): Calculate squared error between
  # the score of a triple and its true value (0, 1). Computed once for each
  # positive and once for each negative triple in the batch.
  #
  # Generally, the loss values are averaged over the batch elements (e.g.,
  # positive triple for 1vsAll and negative_sampling, sp- or po-pair for
  # KvsAll). If multiple loss values arise for each batch element (e.g., when
  # BCE is used), these individual losses are summed up.
  #
  # LibKGE also supports some other losses, which we do not recommend to use.
  # See kge/loss.py for details.

search:
  # Type of search job (see respective configuration key). LibKGE ships with the
  # following jobs: manual_search, grid_search, ax_search, hyperband_search
  type: ax_search

  # Maximum number of parallel training jobs to run during a search.
  num_workers: 1

  # Device pool to use for training jobs. If this list is empty, `job.device` is
  # used for all parallel searches. Otherwise, the first `search.num_workers`
  # devices from this list are used. If the number of devices specified here is
  # less than `search.num_workers`, the list wraps around so that devices are
  # used by multiple jobs in parallel.

  # What to do when an error occurs during a training job. Possible values:
  # continue, abort

  # If false, only creates training job folders but does not run the jobs.
  run: True

  # List of configurations to search. Each entry is a record with a field
  # 'folder' (where the training job is stored) and an arbitrary number of other
  # fields that define the search configuration (e.g.
  # 'train.optimizer_args.lr').

# grid.
grid_search:

  # If false, only creates manual search job configuration file but does not run
  # it. This may be useful to edit the configuration (e.g., change folder names)
  # or to copy the created configurations to an existing manual search job.
  run: True

  # Define the grid. This is a dict where the key is a (flattened or nested)
  # configuration option (e.g., "train.optimizer_args.lr") and the value is an
